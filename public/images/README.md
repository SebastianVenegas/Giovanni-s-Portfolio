# Portfolio Images Directory

This directory contains all the images used in the portfolio website, organized into subdirectories by category.

## Directory Structure

## Image Guidelines

- Use appropriate file formats:
  - **PNG** for logos and images requiring transparency
  - **JPG/JPEG** for photographs and complex images without transparency
  - **SVG** for icons and simple graphics that need to scale
  
- Optimize images for web:
  - Compress images to reduce file size
  - Use appropriate dimensions (don't use 4000px images for small thumbnails)
  - Consider using modern formats like WebP for better compression

- Naming convention:
  - Use lowercase letters
  - Use hyphens instead of spaces
  - Be descriptive but concise
  - Example: `project-dashboard-screenshot.png`
